1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
2. Compile and run the `MatrixMultiplication.java` file.

## Usage

1. Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter the number of rows and columns for matrix 1.
2. Enter the dimensions and press Enter.
3. Repeat the process for matrix 2.
4. If the dimensions are incompatible for matrix multiplication, an error message will be displayed, and the program will exit.
5. If the dimensions are compatible, you will be prompted to enter the elements of matrix 1.
6. Enter the elements row by row and press Enter after each element.
7. Repeat the process for matrix 2.
